### Learn to Fly

**V1**
> Run and tell all of the angels, This could take all night
> Think I need a devil to help me get things right
> Hook me up a new revolution, 'Cause this one is a lie
> I sat around laughing and watched the last one die

**C**

> I'm looking to the sky to save me, Looking for a sign of life
> Looking for something to help me burn out bright
> I'm looking for complication, Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
> Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

**V2**

> I think I'm done nursing patience, It can wait one night
> Give it all away if you give me one last try
> We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
> Run and tell the angels that everything's all right

**C**

> Repeat
> Make my way back home when I learn to...
