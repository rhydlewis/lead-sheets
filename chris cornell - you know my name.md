### You Know My Name

Intro: Bm G E x4

Bm                                         Gm
If you take a life do you know what you'll give?
                    D            
Odds are, you won't like what it is.
Bm                                             Gm 
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?
                 D       F#m  
By the merciless eyes of deceit? 

G         F#m              Bm  A    G#m
I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
G           F#m              Bm A G#m  G  
But you yourself are nothing so divine 
             F#m
Just next in line.

Chorus

Bm                   G                     E
Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
              Bm         G 
The odds will betray you 
           E
And I will replace you 
    Bm             G                     E
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you 
            Bm       G
It longs to kill you 
                   E
Are you willing to die? 

E
The coldest blood runs through my veins 
Bm G E
You know my name 


Bm                                        Gm
If you come inside things will not be the same 
         D             
When you return to the night 
Bm
And if you think you've won 
                 Gm
You never saw me change 
              D           F#m
The game that we all been playing 

G        F#m                   Bm A   G#m  G
I've seen diamonds cut through harder men 
             F#m
Than you yourself
           Bm   A  G#m G 
But if you must pretend 
                  F#m
You may meet your end

If you take a life, do you know what you'll give?
Odds are you won't like what it is
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me
By the merciless eyes of deceit?

I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine
Just next in line

Arm yourself, because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?

The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name

If you come inside, things will not be the same
When you return to the night
And if you think you've won, you never saw me change
The game that we have been playing

I've seen diamonds cut through harder men
Than you yourself
But if you must pretend
You may meet your end

Arm yourself, because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?

The coldest blood runs through my veins

Try to hide your hand, forget how to feel
(Forget how to feel)
Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel
(Spin of the wheel)

Arm yourself, because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?

The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name
(You know my name)
You know my name
(You know my name)
You know my name
You know my name
You know my name!
